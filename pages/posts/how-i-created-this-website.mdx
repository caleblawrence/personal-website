I had been wanting to mess around with Next.js for a while and I love to work with React so that's what I ended up using. 

So far I'm really enjoying it. My favorite thing so far is how easy it was to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/docs). I literally ran one command and changed a couple URLs on Google Domains and the page was up and running. It appears to be using `HTTP2` and `HTTPS` which is awesome. 

Next.js was really easy to use. I love that it removes most configuration stuff and let you just work on the app. It's also really nice to be able to have it build static pages and other be dynamic. [Apparently](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#with-no-ssr) you can even turn off SSR for some pages which is great if I wanted to mess around with something like React Suspense. 

Another really nice think about Next.js is all the [examples](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples) they have on their repo. I largely copied the [blog-starter](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) example to do the blog posts with `.mdx` files because markdown is awesome.
Overall using Next wasn't too different than a normal React app but I haven't done any non static pages so I look forward to doing a page with a form submission or something soon. I'll probably write another post about how that goes.

I did learn a lot about image optimization when making this website. I didn't know that optimizing images was a thing and how much smaller it can make a payload so that was fun to learn about.
I made the website [repo](https://github.com/caleblawrence/personal-website) public so feel free to check it out.
