I've been wanting to make a persosnal website for a while now and I also wanted to learn Next.js so here we are. I'm going to write another post about why I chose Next.js and my experience so far so I won't go into it here. I think writing is a lot of fun and I used to blog a long time ago so that's one of the main reasons for this website. Hopefully, I'll be able to write somewhat consistently.

I'll probably write about a lot of things ranging from web development, faith-based stuff, every day carry/self-defense and who knows what else. I'll also use this website for a lot of other random things like messing around with React and other web dev stuff. So I don't think it will remain a static site for long.

I think having a website makes a lot of sense if you're a web developer. I'm going to use it as a sort of resume as well. I plan on making the repo public as well that way I can directly link to source code for certain pages I'm experimenting with. The domain name was one of the things that was hard as any of the `.com` addresses I wanted were taken so I ended up doing with `.dev`. It was nice that it's only $12 a year for the domain.

From what I've heard writing is a great way to learn things so I'm going to try to write about things that I learn so we'll see how that goes.
