### Computer / Office

- 16" Macbook Pro (2020)
- Durgod Taurus K320 (Brown) Mechanical Keyboard

### Coding

- Visual Studio Code Insiders is what I use basic text editing and UI development.
- Jetbrains Rider is great if you're doing .NET Core projects.
- I'm currently using Fira Code for my font. It's pretty nice.
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal. The "Minimal" theme makes it look great. I've used Hyper before too but it seems to use a lot of memory.
- The Material theme for VSCode and Jetbrains IDE's is amazing and I always use it

### Other Desktop Apps (most of them for coding or just general productivity)

- Google Chrome is my browser of choice.
- Notion is is great for notetaking, task management, wikis, etc. It's basically a "second brain". Previously I used Evernote but Notion is way better and they crank out new features like crazy. One of my favorite things about it is the code block support (with syntax highlighting).
- Spotify is what I use for music.
- GitKraken is a fantastic tool for Git. It lets you easily see what you've changed and do anything Git related. It also looks great.
- Todoist is awesome for tracking to-dos.
- Postman is what I use for making requests to local API's when doing backend work. I've heard there are other (maybe better) tools for this but I haven't gotten around to switching yet.
- TablePlus is one of my favorite applications ever (it's NOT free). Basically it lets you add databases and quickly view and query against them. It works with everything so you don't need to use/learn multiple tools for different databases. Please check out the trial they offer because you'll be impressed.
