Recently I've been listening to a lot of true crime podcasts and it's been really interesting. Not really sure why I started. I guess criminal stuff has always been interesting to me. I watch a lot of crime related videos on Liveleak (basically Youtube but less censorship) and I've always found them fascinating. If the videos didn't make me paranoid enough I now listen to podcasts.

The true crimes one I've been listening to recently are [Crime Junkies](https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/) and [Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad](http://themurdersquad.com/). Both are very interesting. The later seems to be more official as the people that do it both have a background in police work and speak from authority. Crime Junkies is a lot more casual but I love some of the stuff they talk about and the general message they are trying to send.

They talk about trusting your gut feeling when it comes to safety and in the episode I was listening to today when they were talking about a serial killer that lured young girls in they quoted something that stood out to me:

> Be weird, be rude, and stay alive.

From what I can tell they came up with this saying and I think it's the best thing. I guess it might not be obvious what it means to some but it resonated with me when I heard it. I think a lot of criminals exploit the human desire to help others.

Helping others is good. I'm a Christian and I believe it's biblical to help others but not at the expense of your own life. And that might sound stupid but it's not far from the truth. Go ahead and put your address into your local ["Public Sex Offender Website"](https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/SexOffenderRegistry/Search) if you have some doubts. Those are just the people that have been caught. There are evil people everywhere and when someone asks you something, offers you something, or really makes any advance to you at all it is better to be "rude" and stay alive. So help people but be careful when you're doing it and be pro-active about it instead of waiting for someone to ask you. If you see that someone needs help and then offer it I think you're in a much better spot.

When your friends ask you to do something with them that seems somewhat unsafe it is better to be "weird" and stay alive (like decline an invitation to something or better yet if you're a parent don't let your kid take part in something even if people think you're "weird" for it). Being weird can look like a lot of things such as carrying a weapon with you all the time and training with it, having strict rules, not staying out too late, not letting kids go to sleepovers, and the list goes on and on.

In the future I'm looking forward to writing more about personal protection type things like why girls should be into guns more than guys, every day carry stuff, resisting evil people with force, etc. I think that people don't put enough emphasis on it.
